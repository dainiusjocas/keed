\section*{SUMMARY}
\label{summary}

This bachelor thesis is dedicated to classification analysis of noisy, high-dimensional, small-sample biomedical data, which is often found in genetical, gene expression, epigenetics research. Next, we study feature selection methods as they are necessary for the analysis of high-dimensional data. We put special emphasis on robustness of feature selection because this is of paramount importance in the biomedical domain. We evaluate different feature selection methods with respect to computation complexity, accuracy of resulting classifier, and robustness of selected features. Experimental analysis revealed that there is no single best method for the given data and application domain. Therefore, in the summary of our work we provide directions for future research.

\textbf{Keywords:} high-dimensional data, machine learning, classification, feature selection, robustness of feature selection.
